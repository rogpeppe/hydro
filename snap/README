# Hello world!

This is a snappy demo package that shows how to build and package a minimalistic webserver
in golang for snappy. This package is multi-architecture enabled.

To build for both amd64 and armhf, on an amd64 host, create the binaries in the architecture
dependent directories. the magic-bin/go-example-webserver launch script will do the magic
to find the right architecture and launch the right binary.

To build simply do this:

 # change to the x86_64 directory and build the binary...
 1. cd magic-bin/x86_64-linux-gnu
 2. go build ../../

 # switch to the armhf directory and build for ARM
 3. cd ../arm-linux-gnueabihf
 4. GOARCH=arm go build ../../

 # go to top level dir and build the snapp
 5. cd ../..
 6. snappy build .

This produces a snappy package for you that you can try on your snappy system.

Have fun!
